# BarnRaise: Community-Powered Feature Development

## Executive Summary

BarnRaise brings the time-honored tradition of community barn raising to the digital age. Just as farming communities once gathered to build essential infrastructure together, BarnRaise enables open source communities to collectively fund and build the features they need. As a 501(c)(3) nonprofit, we ensure that requesters, maintainers, and developers work together in harmony—because the best software, like the best barns, is raised by the community it serves.

## Mission (501(c)(3) Purpose)

To advance open source software development by fostering collaborative funding and development of features through community participation, mutual respect, and shared benefit—bringing the barn raising spirit to the digital commons.

## Core Concept: The Digital Barn Raising

In traditional barn raisings:
- **Someone needs a barn** → Someone needs a feature
- **Community agrees to help** → Maintainer approves the raising
- **Everyone contributes** → Funders provide resources, developers build
- **Experienced builders lead** → Maintainers guide the work
- **Celebration when complete** → Feature ships to everyone's benefit

## How BarnRaise Works

### The Raising Process

**Phase 1: Call for a Raising**
- A community member identifies a needed feature (the "barn")
- They post a "raising request" with specifications and funding commitment
- The request includes why this "barn" will benefit the community

**Phase 2: Project Leader Buy-In**
- If the project hasn't joined BarnRaise, we help facilitate an introduction
- Project leaders (maintainers) review the proposed raising
- They can accept, modify requirements, or respectfully decline
- Accepted raisings become "active" and visible to builders

**Phase 3: Builders Volunteer**
- Developers see active raisings matching their skills
- They "raise their hand" with their approach and timeline
- Project leaders select the right builder for the job
- The community fund is activated (escrow)

**Phase 4: The Build**
- Builder works on the feature with project leader guidance
- Progress is visible to all participants
- Community can cheer on and support the work

**Phase 5: Completion**
- Builder submits their work
- Project leader reviews and approves
- Funds are distributed
- Community celebrates the new "barn"!

## Value Proposition

## Platform Features & Terminology

### The BarnRaise Language

| Traditional Term | BarnRaise Term | Why It Works |
|-----------------|----------------|--------------|
| Post a bounty | Start a raising | Active, community-focused |
| Accept work | Join the raising | Collaborative, not transactional |
| Maintainer | Project leader / Raising leader | Leadership without gatekeeping |
| Feature requester | Raising sponsor | Contributing to community |
| Developer | Builder | Active, constructive role |
| Escrow account | Community fund | Shared resource pool |
| Platform fee | Community contribution | Supporting the commons |

### Community Fund Model

**Base Structure:**
- 10% community contribution (5% operations, 5% platform sustainability)
- Sponsors can increase their community contribution (slider: 10-20%)
- Builders can contribute back after successful raisings (0-10%)
- Project leaders can designate project fund share (0-25%)

All displayed with barn/community metaphors:
\`\`\`
Your Raising Contribution:
├── Feature Build: 85%
├── Community Operations: 10% 
└── Extra Support (optional): +5%
"Like bringing extra supplies to a barn raising!"
\`\`\`

## Competitive Positioning

**"We're Not a Marketplace, We're a Community"**

Unlike gig platforms (Fiverr/Upwork) or transactional bounty systems:
- **Community decides** what to build (not individual transactions)
- **Project leaders must approve** (respecting existing governance)
- **Nonprofit structure** ensures community benefit over profit
- **Barn raising spirit** means everyone wins together

| Platform | Their Model | Our Difference |
|----------|------------|----------------|
| Gitcoin | Crypto bounties | We use simple fiat payments, community-first |
| IssueHunt | Bug bounties | We build new features, not just fix problems |
| Upwork | Gig marketplace | We're community-driven, not transactional |
| GitHub Sponsors | Ongoing support | We fund specific features with clear delivery |

BarnRaise

Where communities raise the features they need.

Just like traditional barn raisings, open source thrives when 
everyone contributes. Sponsors bring resources. Builders bring 
skills. Project leaders bring wisdom. Together, we build.

"In the spirit of barn raisings, we believe the best software 
is built by the community, for the community."

### The Three Pillars
\`\`\`
HOW BARNRAISE WORKS

1. GATHER THE COMMUNITY
Someone proposes a feature the community needs
"I need this barn"

2. GET AGREEMENT  
Project leaders approve raisings that fit their vision
"Yes, this barn would help everyone"

3. RAISE IT TOGETHER
Builders step forward, funds are secured, feature ships
"Let's build this barn together!"
\`\`\`

### Trust & Community Section
\`\`\`
Built on Trust, Raised by Community

✓ Project Leader Approved - Only features that make sense
✓ Community Fund Protected - Secured before work begins  
✓ Builder Recognition - Celebrate those who contribute
✓ 501(c)(3) Nonprofit - Aligned with open source values

## Visual Identity

### Design Direction
- **Not rustic**: Modern, clean interpretation of barn raising
- **Geometric barn shapes**: Abstract, made from code elements
- **Warm but technical**: Orange/red accents with tech blues
- **Community imagery**: Multiple elements coming together
- **Progress visualization**: Barn frame gradually completing

### Logo Concepts
- Barn outline created from \`< >\` brackets
- Multiple arrows/hands raising a beam
- Geometric barn with community dots around it
- Abstract barn frame resembling a git branch diagram

## Marketing Strategy

### The Story
"When farming communities needed barns, they didn't hire contractors—they came together. Someone brought wood, someone brought nails, someone brought expertise. At the end of the day, the community had a barn that belonged to one family but served everyone. 

We're bringing that same spirit to open source. Features that serve the community, built by the community, with everyone contributing what they can."

### Key Messages
1. **"Raisings, not bounties"** - Community events, not transactions
2. **"Project leader approved"** - Respect for governance
3. **"Community funded"** - Shared investment in success
4. **"Nonprofit for good"** - Aligned with open source values
5. **"Build together"** - Collaborative, not competitive

### Launch Campaign: "The First 100 Barns"
- Goal: 100 features successfully raised in first year
- Track each raising as a "barn" on a virtual map
- Celebrate milestones (10th barn, 50th barn, etc.)
- Create documentary-style content about each raising

## Success Metrics

- **Raisings completed** (not just "bounties filled")
- **Community participation rate** (multiple sponsors per raising)
- **Builder retention** (repeat participants)
- **Project leader satisfaction** (quality of contributions)
- **Community fund efficiency** (% successfully distributed)
- **Time to raising** (from proposal to completion)

## FAQ Positioning

**"Why barn raising?"**
"Because it perfectly captures what we're doing: communities coming together to build essential infrastructure that benefits everyone."

**"Is this just another bounty platform?"**
"No. Bounty platforms are transactional. We're communal. Every raising requires project leader approval and community participation."

**"How is this different from GitHub Sponsors?"**
"Sponsors support ongoing work. Raisings build specific features. Both are important for healthy projects."

**"What if the project leader rejects good work?"**
"Like a barn raising where the frame doesn't fit, sometimes adjustments are needed. Sponsors can choose to support builders anyway, using the forked version as their 'barn.'"
