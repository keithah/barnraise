# BarnRaise 🏗️

> Where communities raise the features they need

BarnRaise is a nonprofit platform that brings the barn-raising tradition to open source software. We enable communities to collectively fund and build features through a unique double opt-in system that respects maintainer autonomy while empowering feature requesters and developers.

## 🌟 Core Concept

Just as farming communities once gathered to build barns together, BarnRaise enables:
- **Sponsors** to fund features they need
- **Project Leaders** to approve what gets built
- **Builders** to get paid for meaningful work
- **Communities** to benefit from new features

## 📋 Key Features

- **Double Opt-In System**: Both requesters and maintainers must agree before work begins
- **Community Fund (Escrow)**: Protected payments for all parties
- **501(c)(3) Nonprofit**: Lower fees, tax-deductible contributions
- **Project Leader Control**: Maintainers approve all raisings
- **Builder Protection**: Get paid even if PR is rejected (sponsor override)

## 🚀 How It Works

1. **Start a Raising** - Sponsor proposes a feature with funding
2. **Get Approval** - Project leader reviews and approves
3. **Find a Builder** - Developers apply, project leader selects
4. **Build Together** - Feature is developed with community support
5. **Celebrate** - Feature ships, funds distributed, community wins!
